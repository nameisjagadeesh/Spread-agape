SQL NOTES  pass Xworkz@123
to manage the info we develop application
3 layers of application= presentation layer(html,css,js),business layer(backend),datalayer
these three layers interconnected with APIs 
APIs perform=Post,get,put,delete(CRUD operation)
presentation layer and business layer connected through http api
business layer and datalayer connected through JDBC,Hibernate(or by writing the SQL to communicate with database)
json=java script object notation
client(laptop) will send request to server to respond the request
mysql=1995
DATABASE =organised collection of data ,these are collected in rows and coloumns i.e TABLES
DDL=(Data defination language)=to create and manage the structure of database =CREATE,ALTER(to alter the existing table)
ALTER=can add table,drop table,rename coloumn,change the datatype,shuffle column
can change the data type int to varchar ,int to bigint , but cant change from varchar to int
DESC table_name =is to find the decription
DDL Commands
1.Create=to create the table to contain data in database
syntax =CREATE DATABASE database_name  (ctr+shift+enter  =to excecute)
SELECT command is only  to read or fetch the data(* is to select all) not to manupulate
FROM is a clause to pull the data
DML statements=data manupulation language = to insert and manage the data
once table excecuted it cannot be modified
TRUNCATE command used to delete the data but structure remains same
DROP TABLE will delete whole table
WHERE is used to filter the data
boolean =true -1,false=0
DML keywords=SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE-------> CRUD operation
DDL=CREATE,ALTER,TRUNCATE,RENAME,DROP
AND operator all entries should be true;
OR operator atleast one is true
Rollback to get data back
DELETE =we can delete data and can be rollback
DROP=delete the entire data and cant rollback
TRUNCATE=delete the data but structure remains same and it cant be rollback.

IN -to avoid multiple ORs conditions
NOT IN -to exclude the perticular data
Between- to select withing the ranges
%= will match any string of any length
%s=find words which  ends with s
s%=find letters which starts with s 
%s%=will find words contains s anywhere
LIKE operator used for varchar,We can use the LIKE command in SQL to identify patterns in a database using character strings.
UPPER and LOWER=convert data into uppercase and lowercase ,here original data will not be modified
concat= will join any two columns,here as used as alias which is a temporary column name
Instr=to find out the any position of any single charecter ,if string contains duplicate chars it will always take first char,takes only one parameter
Substr= to find only some of the charecters,
SUBSTR(stringvalue,startposition,noofcharecter),takes only one parameter
distinct =to avoid the duplicate values and return the unique values,takes only one parameter
Agrregate Functions= perform calculation on a colums,these are only used for numeric data
and original data will not be modified.
1.COUNT= SELECT * from table_name ,it will check no of rows
2.SUM= sum all the data from column
3.MAX=find max value
4.MIN ,AVG
ENUM=is a kind of datatype,selects from that constants only ,we can select the enum name or position of the enum type
LENGTH=calculate the length of charecters in a colum ,only used one column
LTRM -left remove the leading spaces
RTRIM-remove the right side trail spaces we cant remove middle space lik "jagg uuu* for this we have to use regular expression
ORDER BY- by default it will be ascending ,use desc to show descinding order, in real we sould use it for numeric data
CONSTRAINTS (validation)= to limit or set some rules for the data ,ex-to avoid null n duplicate values constarints are applied to only column while table creation and while altering the table types of constraints-1.notNull=it will not accept null values in clolumns ,it will accept duplicate values
2.Unique= it will not accept the duplicate values but accept null values
3. CHECK=to limit the range of the values, applied to cloumns not null, unique, check are coulmn level constraints columnname datatype not null
constraint violation - any error related to constraint
4>primary key-uniqly identifies each n evry row and column,bydefault it has unique and not null constarints
every table has primary key,but each table has only one primarykey,column can have multiple primarykey
Foreign key=is a column in one table that refers  to primary key of other table
primary key is present in parent table ,u cant drop the parent table ,first child table should be dropped
foreign key is present in child table  ,it can accept duplicate values
primary key and foreign key should always be same n these are table level constarints 
not null,unique,check are the column level constraints
purpose of foreign and primary key is to establish the relation between two tables
autoincrement-only for ids where it is not duplicated
currentdate : SELECT current_date();
datediff= SELECT datediff('2023-01-25',2023-01-12);

The schema represents the logical structures of data. Using schemas, the database objects can be grouped logically in a database.

TCL(Transaction Control Language)=TCL commands are basically used for managing and controlling the transactions in a database to maintain consistency. And it also helps a user manage all the changes made by the DML commands for maintaining its transactions.
 COMMIT(permanent delete which will not rollback),
ROLLBACK,SAVEPOINT(to roll back used to mark the table);
