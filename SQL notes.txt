SQL NOTES  pass Xworkz@123
to manage the info we develop application
3 layers of application= presentation layer(html,css,js),business layer(backend),datalayer
these three layers interconnected with APIs 
APIs perform=Post,get,put,delete(CRUD operation)
presentation layer and business layer connected through http api
business layer and datalayer connected through JDBC,Hibernate(or by writing the SQL to communicate with database)
json=java script object notation
client(laptop) will send request to server to respond the request
mysql=1995
DATABASE =organised collection of data ,these are collected in rows and coloumns i.e TABLES
DDL=(Data defination language)=to create and manage the structure of database =CREATE,ALTER(to alter the existing table)
ALTER=can add table,drop table,rename coloumn,change the datatype,shuffle column
can change the data type int to varchar ,int to bigint , but cant change from varchar to int
DESC table_name =is to find the decription
DDL Commands
1.Create=to create the table to contain data in database
syntax =CREATE DATABASE database_name  (ctr+shift+enter  =to excecute)
SELECT command is only  to read or fetch the data(* is to select all) not to manupulate
FROM is a clause to pull the data
DML statements=data manupulation language = to insert and manage the data
once table excecuted it cannot be modified
TRUNCATE command used to delete the data but structure remains same
DROP TABLE will delete whole table
WHERE is used to filter the data
boolean =true -1,false=0
DML keywords=SELECT,INSTERT,UPDATE,DELETE-------> CRUD operation
DDL=CREATE,ALTER,TRUNCATE,RENAME,DROP
AND operator all entries should be true;
OR operator atleast one is true
Rollback to get data back
DELETE =we can delete data and can be rollback
DROP=delete the entire data and cant rollback
TRUNCATE=delete the data but structure remains same and it cant be rollback.

IN -to avoid multiple ORs conditions
NOT IN -to exclude the perticular data
Between- to select withing the ranges
%= will match any string of any length
%s=find words which  ends with s
s%=find letters which starts with s 
%s%=will find words contains s anywhere
LIKE operator used for varchar
UPPER and LOWER=convert data into uppercase and lowercase ,here original data will not be modified
concat= will join any two columns,here as used as alias which is a temporary column name
Instr=to find out the any position of any single charecter ,if string contains duplicate chars it will always take first char,takes only one parameter
Substr= to find only some of the charecters,
SUBSTR(stringvalue,startposition,noofcharecter),takes only one parameter
distinct =to avoid the duplicate values and return the unique values,takes only one parameter
