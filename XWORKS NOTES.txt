X-WORKZ CLASS NOTES 24/08/22
JAVA IS DEVELOPED BY JAMES GOSLING
java is high level object oriented programing language
object oriented means a way to develop softeware
language is a means of communication
programming language is any language that is executed on computer system 
program is the decision , set of activity combined to perform a specific task
syntax in java is grammer to undertand n follow ,it is provides by pro lang
main purpose of devlopper is to maintain and the manage the user data
JDK:JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT>WRITING PROGRAM>JAVA TO RUN PROGRAM;JAVAC TO CONVERT ENGLISH TO JAVA
JRE:JAVA RUNTIME ENV>RUN PROGRAM , JRE HAS JVM
JVM:JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE>RUNS N EXCECUTE THE PROGRAM
JRE CONSIST OF JVM
JDK is basically a software development environment which is used to develop applications and applets.  jdk has tools and bins
Jre is a set of software tools which provides the run time environment , it contains set of liberaries
JRE is implementation of JVM.

JAVA IS WIDELY USED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR CODING WEB APPLICATION
JAVAC COMPILES PROGRAM LANGUAGE INTO CLASS FILES THAT RUN ON THE JVM ,JAVAC USES JRE
features of java =simple,robust,platform independent,portability,java is WORA

platform is combinatiom of software n hardesware ex;ios n hardeware
java is platform independent
WORA -WRITE ONCE RUN ANYWHERE once compiled i
byte code is a special format which is understood by only JVM,CLASS=BYTE CODE
javac generates bytecode
developers writes source code
PLATFORM INDEPENDENT, IS JAVA COMPILED CODE (BYTE CODE) CAN RUN ON ALL OS
Datatype is a set of values and set of operations defined on those values
Variables are containers which stores the values

jAVA IS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,JAVA REPRESENTS REAL WORLD
OBJECT/class/things HAS STATES(DATA) AND BEHAVIOUR(ACTION)
jvm look for main method to execute
PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN(STRING[] ARG) =main method

main method is first method to start program
MEMORY RAM, HEAP MEMORY, META SPACE
HEAP TO EXECUTE JAVA PRO
CLASS LOADER IS A CLASS/object WHICH LOADS INFO OF CLASSES INTO META SPACE ,JVM USES CLASS LOADER
META SPACE IS TO LOAD CLASS INFO
STACK TO EXECUTE METHODS ,it will look for perticular mathod
CONSTANT POOL TO SToRE PREMITIVE
INSTANCE MEMORY TO STORE NON PREMITIVE
system.out.println(statement)> system:is class,. is a dot operator,out: static variable ,statement is args , println is static method , S should b in caps
output in java is information
use of writing program is to represent objec ,
data=is variable.> ways/types=static,instance,loacal,parameter ,data is use to store data
declaring a variable=datatype refname(value)ex: Pizza pizza;
initialise a variable=by adding ;(semicolon which means end of statemnet)
datatype in java are 2 types =premitive n non premitive, premitive is to denote values, non primitive to compex value
types of primitive parameter(java dataypes)=byte ,short ,int , long ,float ,double, boolean, char

non primitive =any class we write is non premitive ,types=countless
any class will  have state and behaviour
local variable=declared within method body
pop=removing  a method
concatenation to add  which join results,adding strings together(+)
if two ref pointing to same memory we have to use "doble equals operater(==)" ,it will never check value

variable can never hold value it will only ref to adress
Scopes{}=using the data in a boundary ,ex;voter id scope is ward ,DL-nation with bigger scope passport;worldwide
wrapper classes=Object representation of primitive data type is called wrapper class.

reference is pointing to adress
variable is something which changes
ref variable which changes the adress
array is a collection of similara types of datatype or collection of variables of the same data type ,array is a container to store multiple data
array is non primitive ,any class is non premitive which has state n behaviour
primitive has no state and behaviour
array is group of reference of any dataypes(premitive or non premitive) array is also a data type "(datatype[] variablename}" ex=char []sizes;
[]is to hold multiple reference 
two ways to initialise array :{} or new keyword
index=length-1

string is a sequence of charecters=String =""
default value is given by jvm static n instance variable
local variable is one which is within main method
static, instance variable are class varibales
local and parameter are methods

null =which is pointing to no memory adress; it can be only non primitive
void=is return type which ref to no adress
return is use to stop the execution in any method
break is use to stop in loop
method is the set of statements;
parameter is a local variable which is declared within (),it can be initiated inside and outside,cant be declared before initialisation
local variable is declared within body only(inside),it can be initialised before declaration,
argument is a reference passed to method()

polymarphism is using same word in java to mean different things in differentcontext or (same thing but in different form)
2 types of polymarphism =compile time (overloading) and run time (overridding)
types of polymarphism=overloading-which is of same method but different in parameter ,overloading is a compile time polymarphism
variable can be initialised in 4 ways==literals,constructor,methods,class(or reference)

import of package
1. import statement : use classes from same package
2. in-line import : use when two classes with same name, from different package 
3. static import : to use static members without using class name 
4. wild card imports : use multiple classes from same package

copy : static has one copy n nonstatic has many copies
constructor is a special mathod ,it is same as class name ex:Bike() or Bike();  
constructor has no return type
constructor used with new key word
compiler will provides no-argument constructor
public Gold(){} is constructor type
public void Gold(){} is method type -instance method
instantiation is initiating the non primitive,it is making copies in instance memory
initialisation for primitive instance variables,instance creates many copies

New is a keyword which allocates the memory in instance and it used to create an object
instance creation/object creation ex =Song type=new Song;
Garbage Collection in java when ref is not pointing to any memory java (JVM) will automatically clear or recliams that memory
FQN=Fully Qualified Name is path+classname 

constructors are mainly used to initialise instance variable during instance creation ,Constructor gets called at the time of object creation.
types of constructor:1.default constructor(When user don’t define any constructor, compiler provides a default constructor.)
The access modifier of default constructor is same as that of the class.
2.custom constructor:User defined constructor is also known as custom constructor.The access modifier of custom constructor can be either public or protected or default or Private.
4 ways to initialise constructor =literals(default),reference(to update),constructor and methods
instance means copy			
constructor can be executed in stack ,constructor is not a member
if the constructors are marked as static, they can not be called from the child class;
this. is a keyword used when instance variable names and local variable names are same
this. keyword used in variable,methods,constructor
c programing language was developed by Dennis Richie
constructor chaining=when one constructor calls another constructor 
A copy constructor in a Java class is a constructor that creates an object using another object of the same Java class.
ex of copy constructor= constructor1{}        constructor2(){constructor1}

types of chaining=super(default/implicit::when calling from parent class) and this(calling from same class)
class level variable=static and non static
class variables=static 
any example we say is class,datatype,nonprimitive,object
F6 to execute one by one
F8 to close n come out
shortcut to declare and initialise constructor alr+shift+s+o/source in eclipse
Enum is a special class or datatype that represent a group of constants (which are unchangable variables like final variable)

Association in java is a connection or relation between two separate classes that are set up through their objects
relations are two types :: 1.inheritance(IS-A which is used for related things ex:Jagadeesh is good man) 
2.Association(HAS-A which is used for unrelated things ex: jagadeesh has a iphone)
null point exeptioner=when reference is not pointing to any memory and we try to access that variable
static can be accessed using the class name and reference but instance is accessed only by reference

Access specifier control who can access and modify, it is  used at class , constructor, properties,method
4 access specifier: private (only inner class), protected(only inner class), default(only within same package ),  public(class , constructor, properties,method ,where it allows other classes from different package to access)
Magical package: these are default packages which dont need import , jre automatically imports
Access specifier provides the visibility 


ENCAPSULATION:: restricting direct access of properties and providing access using method

Class is a blueprint/or templet it contains variables and datatype
class loader is an object responible for loading the class ,it is a abstraction class
dot operater(.)is used to access thr instance variable and methods of class objects
for loop  =4 condition: initialization , condition check, checks if it is true and enter the loops and finally increament or decreament.
  

Inheritance means one class aquiring members(properties and methods) of another class
Inheritance ( extends keyword)
Parent ( has members).  Child ( is a class) Inheritance doesn’t need references
inheritance types =single,multilevel and heirarchial
in java multiple and hybrid inheritance is not possible ,for this we need interface
inheritance use is to overridding and re-usability(to avoid duplicate)  and to achieve polymarphism
Invisible parent is object and object is a superclass and object is in magical package  
any class we write is a part of object which is polymorphic in nameture(diff form)
casting=converting the parent reference to sub ckass(child class) only when parent ref is pointing to childclass ex:childclass name ref=(childclass name) parentclass ref OR "Creating an object of sub class and referring it by super class reference variable is called"
upcasting.
constructors are not inherited bcz they used to just initialisation of instance variable
java doesn’t support multiple inheritance by class but supports from interface
static members are not inherited

Class and parents terminologies 
childclass/subclass/derivedclass
Parent/superclass/baseclass

variable is a ref to address and it stores the value.
jvm decides which method to executes at run time(from parent or child) this is called as run time polymarphism
run time polymarphism achieved by overridding
overridding is compile time bcz compiler will check the errors during the method overridding(@overridding)
@(annotation) was introduced during java 1.5version ,it will check compile time errors.


Method :
What is a method ?
Ans :
→ A method is a set of instructions/statements or block of code which performs a specific task.
→ Method can return either primitive data or non primitive data.
→ Method can't return multiple primitive data types (eg : method can't return both int
and String at the same time).
→ But, It can return collection of homogeneous data type. ( eg : int[] array or String[]
array etc..)

When we use protected keyword we can initiate and create instance within same package but not possible to creat instance in different package, in different package it will be accessed by only inheritance but not accessed by reference 
2 ways to access constructor: by new keyword and by super chaining
Pointer is a kind of variable which points to memory of an address they are not used in java bcz they are unsecured 

We can’t override the static method bcz method overrridding is dynamic during run time and static methods are binded at compile time  but static methods can be inherited
final keyword used with class ,variable and method
By using final keyword at class level we can stop inheritance and cant be extended 
When we use make method as final we can inherit the method but can’t be overridden 
Out of 11 methods of object only 9 methods are accessed using reference
