X-WORKZ CLASS NOTES 24/08/22
JAVA IS DEVELOPED BY JAMES GOSLING
java is high level object oriented programing language
object oriented means a way to develop softeware
language is a means of communication
programming language is any language that is executed on computer system 
program is the decision , set of activity combined to perform a specific task
syntax in java is grammer to undertand n follow ,it is provides by pro lang
main purpose of devlopper is to maintain and the manage the user data
JDK:JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT>WRITING PROGRAM>JAVA TO RUN PROGRAM;JAVAC TO CONVERT ENGLISH TO JAVA
JRE:JAVA RUNTIME ENV>RUN PROGRAM , JRE HAS JVM
JVM:JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE>RUNS N EXCECUTE THE PROGRAM
JRE CONSIST OF JVM
JAVA IS WIDELY USED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR CODING WEB APPLICATION
JAVAC COMPILES PROGRAM LANGUAGE INTO CLASS FILES THAT RUN ON THE JVM ,JAVAC USES JRE

platform is combinatiom of software n hardesware ex;ios n hardeware
java is platform independent
WORA -WRITE ONCE RUN ANYWHERE once compiled i
byte code is a special format which is understood by only JVM,CLASS=BYTE CODE
javac generates bytecode
developers writes source code
PLATFORM INDEPENDENT, IS JAVA COMPILED CODE (BYTE CODE) CAN RUN ON ALL OS
Datatype is a set of values and set of operations defined on those values
Variables are containers which stores the values

jAVA IS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE,JAVA REPRESENTS REAL WORLD
OBJECT HAS STATES(DATA) AND BEHAVIOUR(ACTION)
jvm look for main method to execute
PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN(STRING[] ARG)

main method is first method to start program
MEMORY RAM, HEAP MEMORY, META SPACE
HEAP TO EXECUTE JAVA PRO
CLASS LOADER IS A CLASS WHICH LOADS INFO OF CLASSES INTO META SPACE ,JVM USES CLASS LOADER
META SPACE IS TO LOAD CLASS INFO
STACK TO EXECUTE METHODS ,it will look for perticular mathod
CONSTANT POOL TO SToRE PREMITIVE
INSTANCE MEMORY TO STORE NON PREMITIVE
system.out.println(statement)> system:is class,. is operator,out: static variable ,statement is args , println is static method , S should b in caps
output in java is information
use of writing program is to represent objec ,
data=is variable.> ways/types=static,instance,loacal,parameter ,data is use to store data
declaring a variable=datatype refname(value)
initialise a variable=by adding ;(semicolon which means end of statemnet)
datatype in java are 2 types =premitive n non premitive, premitive is to denote values, non primitive to compex value
tyepes of primitive parameter(java dataypes)=byte ,short ,int , long ,float ,double, boolean, char

non primitive =any class we write is non premitive ,types=countless
any class will  have state and behaviour
local variable=declared within method body
pop=removing  a method
concatenation to add  which join results,adding strings together(+)
if two ref pointing to same memory we have to use "doble equals operater(==)" ,it will never check value

variable can never hold value it will only ref to adress
Scopes{}=using the data in a boundary ,ex;voter id scope is ward ,DL-nation with bigger scope passport;worldwide

reference is pointing to adress
variable is something which changes
ref variable which changes the adress
array is a collection of similara types of datatype or collection of variables of the same data type ,array is a container to store multiple data
array is non primitive ,any class is non premitive which has state n behaviour
primitive has no state and behaviour
array is group of reference of any dataypes(premitive or non premitive) array is also a data type "(datatype[] variablename}" ex=char []sizes;
[]is to hold multiple reference 
two ways to initialise array :{} or new keyword
index=length-1

string is a sequence of charecters=String =""
default value is given by jvm static n instance variable
local variable is one which is within main method
static, instance variable are class varibales
local and parameter are methods

null =which is pointing to no memory adress; it can be only non primitive
void=is return type which ref to no adress
return is use to stop the execution in any method
break is use to stop in loop
method is the set of statements;
parameter is a local variable which is declared within (),it can be initiated inside and outside,cant be declared before initialisation
local variable is declared within body only(inside),it can be initialised before declaration,
argument is a reference passed to method()

polymarphism is using same word in java to mean different things in differentcontext or (same thing but in different form)
types of polymarphism=overloading-which is of same method but different in parameter ,overloading is a compile time polymarphism
variable can be initialised in 4 ways==literals,constructor,methods,class(or reference)

import of package
1. import statement : use classes from same package
2. in-line import : use when two classes with same name, from different package 
3. static import : to use static members without using class name 
4. wild card imports : use multiple classes from same package

copy : static has one copy n nonstatic has many copies
constructor is a special mathod ,it is same as class name ex:Bike() or Bike();  
constructor has no return type
compiler will provides no-argument constructor
public Gold(){} is constructor type
public void Gold(){} is method type -instance method
instantiation is initiating the non primitive,it is making copies in instance memory
initialisation for primitive instance variables,instance creates many copies

New is a keyword which allocates the memory in instance
instance creation/object creation ex =Song type=new Song;
Garbage Collection in java when ref is not pointing to any memory java (JVM) will automatically clear or recliams that memory
FQN=Fully Qualified Name is path+classname 

constructors are mainly used to initialise instance variable during instance creation
4 ways to initialise constructor =literals(default),reference(to update),constructor and methods
instance means copy			
constructor can be executed in stack
this. is a keyword used when instance variable names and local variable names are same
this. keyword used in variable,methods,constructor
c programing language was developed by Dennis Richie
constructor chaining=when one constructor calls another constructor 
types of chaining=super(default/implicit::when calling from parent class) and this(calling from same class)
class level variable=static and non static
class variables=static 
any example we say is class,datatype,nonprimitive,object
F6 to execute one by one
F8 to close n come out
shortcut to declare and initialise constructor alr+shift+s+o

Association in java is a connection or relation between two separate classes that are set up through their objects
relations are two types :: 1.inheritance(IS-A which is used for related things ex:Jagadeesh is good man) 
2.Association(HAS-A which is used for unrelated things ex: jagadeesh has a iphone)
