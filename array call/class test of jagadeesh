1.what is platform independent?
    platform independent in any programming is condition  where  program once compiled it can be run on any platform or OS . java is one kind of example of platform  
	independent ,java can be run on any platform .WORA(Orite Once Run anywhere) in programming makes it platform independent
	example:java ,bytecode(.class file)
	platform independent programs can be run on any OS like android ,IOS,window.....etc
	this will make the job of programming easy which can be accessed from any platform
	java programming language was the first platform independent language.
	
	
2.difference between primitive and non primitive data type?
  primitive datatype:is one which has no states and behaviour 
  primitive datatype are 8 types=byte,short,int,long,double,float,boolean,char(charecter).
  non primitive datatype:are variables which has states and behaviour.
  example of non primitive:array,string or anyclass we declare.
  
3.class and its members?
  class is kind of name given while writing the program ,class is type of non primitive data type 
  members of class=class name ,references,statements...etc(i dont have much knowledge and i will learn about this)
  
4.class Marksheet{
public static void main(String[] args){
int total marks =600;
int total marks received=554;
float total percentage =0.0f;
System.out.println("enetered marks and percentage");
float percentage=received marks/total makrks*100;
System.out.println("the percentage of marks:"+percentage);
return;
}
}

 

6.main method with memory it executes in?
   main method is a kind of syntax used while writing the program ,JVM always looks for the main method before executes the program.
   the memory used in main methods are=heapmemory,metaspace,stack,constanypool,classloader,instance memory.
   the stack memory used to execute the methods by creating the frames one above the above and deletes them once the executed .
   constantpool use to stote the values
   metaspace to load the info of class loader
   class loader store the info of class.
   
   
7.class Reverse{
public static void main(String[] args){
int numbers={5,65,84,9,75,98,45,25}
System.out.println("finding reverse numbers");
for(int index=numbers.length-1;index<numbers.length;index--)
  int reverse=numbers[index]
  System.out.println( "backward number :"+reverse);
 System.out.println("found reverse numbers"); 
}
}
   
8.class TimeRunner{
public static void main(String[] args){
short hours=0;
short second=0;
System.out.println("converting hours into seconds");
short hours=2;
short seconds=hours/60*60;
System.out.println("converted time:"+seconds);
System.out.println("converted  hours into seconds");  //i am not sure whether it is correct or not ,but i will learn about this.

}
}
